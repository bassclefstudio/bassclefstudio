# Hi there! I'm bassclefstudio, a student and ameteur .NET developer!

## Currently working on:
 - Cross-platform [AppModel](https://github.com/bassclefstudio/AppModel) library, for building .NET apps that can run on multiple OSes and platforms and use platform-dependent features like file pickers, notifications, background tasks and more!
 - A [graphics library](https://github.com/bassclefstudio/Graphics-Libraries) for abstracting 2d graphics development and turtle-graphics-esque coding on .NET Core, as well as advanced features like camera transformations and drawing SVGs.
 - *Coming soon* Beta release of an AppModel-based app for time-tracking and scheduling, designed with students with complex schedules in mind! Initially planned to be available for Windows 10, with mobile/web apps potentially in the future.
 - And a whole host of other projects, many of which are public repositories licensed using the [MIT license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/), which means you can use and build off of my work for free in your own projects!
 - You can also find a few of my side projects [on Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/bassclefstudio/) if you're so inclined.

## About Me
Outside of programming I enjoy classical music, hiking, and getting lost in the forest of all knowledge!
